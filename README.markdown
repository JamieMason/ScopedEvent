ScopedEvent

* is a Publisher/Subscriber Event Manager.
* works well with Developers who;
    * analyse the events in their application to look for conceptual groups.
    * identify hierarchies of broader and narrower event types within those groups.
* allows you to listen for;
    * specific, granular events (just like any event manager).
    * events of a generalised type in order to more easily provide higher level functionality, normally related to state, logging and detailed analytics.
