**ScopedEvent** aims to help support how Classes that make up an application communicate, and to lessen to what degree Observers need to know about notifiers they observe.

**ScopedEvent** also supports binding to higher-level event types, in order to be notified whenever any lower-level event of that broad type occurs.

More detail is available in the [ScopedEvent Wiki](https://github.com/JamieMason/ScopedEvent/wiki).
